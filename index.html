                <p>We get it, sometimes all you want is an excellent deal on High-Speed Internet, but it’s important to
                    compare all the offers available at your address, because sometimes the bundle deals can actually
                    save you a lot of money.</p>
                <p>Now that service providers are competing with streaming services for your business, the bundle
                    packages are more discounted than ever before, and they often include flexible terms, gift card
                    bonuses, and premium channels at no additional costs. So, while you’re searching for the best deal
                    on the fastest Wifi, be sure to see if bundling your Internet with TV and Phone service makes sense
                    for you.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The information learned from this Website's users will help Bridgevine provide an enhanced online
                        experience for its subscribers. Bridgevine tracks certain information about users (as further
                        described below), including, but not limited to, the type of browser being used by the visitor
                        (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) in
                        use by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g.,
                        Bridgevine Internet). By having this information, Web pages optimized for a particular visitor's
                        preferences are automatically made available to that visitor.</p>
                    <p>Personally identifiable data (as further described below) about visitors to this Site are
                        collected by Bridgevine, for example, when users register or subscribe for newsletters, accounts
                        or features, change services or service settings on our Website, make online purchases, enter
                        sweepstakes and contests, complete surveys, contribute to a chat room, message board, blog, or
                        other similar open forum on our Website, submit a comment or question to us using a "contact us"
                        or similar feature on our Website, or send us an email, or in any other way submit personal
                        information to us via our Website. We may use your personally identifiable information to send
                        you notices (for example, in the form of emails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise
                        correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others,
                        that we think might interest you, unless you choose to opt-out of these mailings (as described

                    <p>Bridgevine sites (other than this Site), as well as any other third-party sites linked to from
                        this Site, may each have different privacy policies and practices. Bridgevine is not responsible
                        for the information practices of non-Bridgevine sites, or channels or areas of this Site, that
                        are operated by third parties. You should carefully review these other privacy policies in order
                        to determine how each third party may use any personal information you provide.</p>
                    <p>When you submit your information to Bridgevine, you are agreeing to receive additional
                        information, via the information submitted, including updates on digital product offerings,

                        be of interest to you from Bridgevine or our business partners. Our site's Availability Form
                        requires certain information for the purpose of determining if service is available. This
                        information will be sent to our business partners for order processing and fulfillment. The
                        business partner may require additional information from you to complete the order process. That
                        information will be gathered on the business partner’s website, via the telephone and/or
                        Bridgevine's Website. <strong>We may use your phone number to follow-up with you via
                            phone.</strong></p>

                    <p>Bridgevine receives and stores certain types of website usage information whenever you interact
                        with and navigate through our Website. Here are the types of website usage information
                        Bridgevine gathers and how it is used.</p>

                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>We may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data
                        files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your
                        computer's hard drive. Cookies track where you travel on our Website and what you look at and
                        purchase. They may store, for example, the information in your shopping cart, and/or your
                        username and/or password. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience
                        on our Website.</p>
                    <p>Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you
                        with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed
                        on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies (technically
                        known as Flash “local shared objects”). However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude
                        you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Website or certain areas or
                        features of the Website.</p>

                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Clear GIFs</strong></p>
                    <p>We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the
                        Website and/or in our communications with you, for example, to enable us to know whether you
                        have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent
                        image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an email or
                        other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the
                        verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.</p>

                    <p>Our server automatically collects data about your server's Internet address when you visit us.
                        This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's
                        automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you are on
                        the Internet. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP Address and
                        sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us
                        (e.g., another site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the site you visit
                        after this Website; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web
                        browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you
                        have entered on this Website or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by
                        our Web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose
                        problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to
                        gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.

                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Do Not Call List Information</strong></p>
                    <p>Effective October 3, 2003, telemarketing rules went into effect as promulgated by the Federal
                        Trade Commission for the National Do Not Call Registry. If the person has not made a previous
                        request, an outbound telemarketing call still may not be made if the person's number is on the
                        "do-not-call" registry. 16 C.F.R. 310(b)(1)(iii)(B). There are two exceptions to the prohibition
                        against calling a person on the "do-not-call" registry: (1) express agreement, in writing,
                        including the telephone number to which calls may be placed and the signature of that person
                        (which may include an electronic or digital signature), 16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(B)(i); (2)
                        the seller has an "established business relationship" with the person and the person has not
                        previously made a specific objection to receiving a call by or on behalf of the seller.</p>
                    <p>The FTC rules further define an "established business relationship" as including a "relationship
                        between a seller and a consumer based on:… (2) the consumer's inquiry or application regarding a
                        product or service offered by the seller, within the three (3) months immediately preceding the
                        date of a telemarketing call." 16 C.F.R. 310.2(n)(2).</p>
                    <p>A seller cannot call a person who has "previously stated that he or she does not wish to receive
                        an outbound telephone call made by or on behalf of the seller whose goods or services are being
                        offered." 16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(A).</p>
                    <p>Bridgevine does not make outbound telemarketing calls, although we may follow up via email or
                        telephone with users with whom we have established a business relationship in order to provide
                        additional relevant information or to assist users during the ordering process. If you do not
                        wish to receive further email or telephone communications from us, please use one of the
                        procedures above under the heading “Choice/Opt Out.”</p>
